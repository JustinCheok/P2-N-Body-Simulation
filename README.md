PS2: N-Body Simulation


What is this assignment:  
The purpose of this assignment was to create a solar system simulation. This assignment was
separated in two parts. In the first part we needed to create a program that loads and displays a
static universe. The assignment used a given file which contained everything needed for the
universe (the planets). The assignment called to be able to have the planets in a linear order and
to have the positions printed on the console. In the second part of this assignment the goal was to
add physics to the simulation. In order to do that we needed to implement a few equations which
included: pairwise force, acceleration and velocity.

What was accomplished:  
What I accomplished from this assignment was I created a universe that began in a linear
formation. The assignment soon later became a full on working solar system that rotated around
the sun. I was also able to get the position of each planet printed to the console.

Key algorithms:  
The key algorithm used was a mix of sorting and finding the min/ max. Sorting was somewhat
used when figuring out how to get planets from the file to the window. Finding the min/max was
also used because if you didnâ€™t implement the equations correctly the planets would rotate
incorrectly.

Data Structures:  
This assignment used a stack data structure. In the first part of the assignment we needed to
create the planets in a linear path. First, initialing the sun into the center of the window, which
would then make it easier to figure out the placement for the other planets.
